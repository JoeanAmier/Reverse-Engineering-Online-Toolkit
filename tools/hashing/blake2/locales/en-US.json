    "aboutDesc": "BLAKE2 is a fast and secure cryptographic hash function designed by Jean-Philippe Aumasson and others. It is faster than MD5 and SHA-2 while providing higher security. BLAKE2b is optimized for 64-bit platforms with up to 64 bytes output; BLAKE2s is optimized for 32-bit platforms with up to 32 bytes output."
